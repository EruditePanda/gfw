        <p>The infographics that appear in the country profile header were created using tree cover and tree cover loss and gain data from Hansen/UMD/Google/USGS/NASA. For more information on these data, please visit the <a href="http://data.globalforestwatch.org/" target="_blank">Open Data Portal</a>.</p>

        <p>The infographics can be viewed by country or by subnational boundary. Click "Select Jurisdiction" to view data for a different region.</p>

        <p>Due to variation in research methodology and/or date of content, tree cover and tree cover loss and gain statistics cannot be compared against each other. Accordingly, “net” loss cannot be calculated by subtracting tree cover gain from tree cover loss, and current (or post-2000) tree cover cannot be determined by subtracting annual tree cover loss from year 2000 tree cover.</p>

        <p>Please also be aware that “tree cover” does not equate to “forest cover.” “Tree cover” refers to the biophysical presence of trees, which may be a part of natural forests or tree plantations. Thus, loss of tree cover may occur for many reasons, including deforestation, fire, and logging within the course of sustainable forestry operations. Similarly, tree cover gain may indicate the growth of tree canopy within natural or managed forests.</p>

        <p>Finally, note that "Select Jurisdiction" and "Tree Cover Canopy Settings" only affect infographics within the top portion of the Country Profiles and do not apply to FORMA, Forest Type, People & Economy or to other parts of this page.</p>
